# README
This repository contains several scripts and data files meant to be used together with the UppASD software (v3.0) - see UppASD_manual.pdf for further details.

Each folder in the repository contains a 'readme.txt' file that gives information about its content.

Results obtained with these scripts are described in my [master thesis](./master_thesis_matteo_stifano.pdf).
